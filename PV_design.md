# Goals of this assignment

Learn how to size a PV system installation
- we will use a free tool from SMA: https://www.sunnydesignweb.com/
- we will dive in the details of the PV system installation

Side goals:
- evaluate the potential of the ULiège buildings
- compare to their consumption
- evauate the benefit of storage 

---

# Sizing without storage

All the energy generated is fed to the grid at a given fee of 130 EUR / MWh.

Use an all-in cost of the PV installation of 800 EUR/kWp (relatively large installation).


---

## Choose a building

- **TODO** List of buildings 

---

## Design the installation using the 3D modeling tool

 - Delimit the surfaces
 - Place a maximum of PV panels

---

## Choose the inverters

 - Organize the PV strings to meet a trade-off between cost and energy-yield (for the amount of PV panels defined previously)
 - What are the constraints to connect the strings
 - What is a polystring configuration?
 - What is the minimal power rating of the inverter you can use for the given amount of PV panels ? What's his energy yield?

#  Sizing with self-consumtpion

 - **TODO** Obtain consumption data from ULiège’s buildings
 - **TODO** See how to insert them in SMA sunny design web
 - **TODO** test to see the difference

---

# Sizing with storage and self-consumtpion

 - **TODO** Redo the analysis and determine how much storage power / energy you would need fct of the cost

---

# Report

 - SMA sizing reports
